# Using Python & Tableau to Analyze Indegoâ€™s Bike Trips & Locations in Philadelphia

Using Python's Beautiful Soup library to extract all the Indego site locations from Philadelphia was an enjoyable experience for me. It provided me with the opportunity to gain further knowledge of web scraping libraries and enhance my Python skills. Moreover, after cleaning and combining historical data, I created a captivating Tableau dashboard. I invite you to explore my data visualization and visit my blog to discover more about my project journey at https://gshah300.medium.com/analyzing-indego-bike-sharing-service-2b89f09ecc64.
